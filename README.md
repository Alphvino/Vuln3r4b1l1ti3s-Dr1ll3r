# XSS
XSS stands for XSS Simple Scanner

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
` python scanner.py 'https://www.site.com' `

## Options
There are 2 options:
1. "-c" or "--custom", use this option if you want to use a custom xss payload for the scan
2. "-wl" or "--wordlist", use this option if you want to use a wordlist of xss payloads

## What I'm going to add...
I'm working for adding an option that allows you to select a list of sites to scan.
After that I'll implement also SQLi and LFI.

Happy Scan!
